# 🏄‍♂️ Go Adventure - Learning Go One Step at a Time

> **Haya guys! 👋** I'm trying to start with my Go journey, and this repo is my playground for learning, experimenting, and improving my coding skills. It may look like a mess (for now), but I promise, it’s a beautiful mess! 😄

## 💡 About This Repository

 Go Repository, where you'll find code that's **100% experimentation! I'm diving into Go to grow my skill set and, hopefully, my confidence in handling more languages. 

Here’s what you might see here (when I figure it out): 

---

1. **Im learning API** 🌎
2. **Basic Go Syntax & Functions** - Experiments with `func`, loops, and other Go basics. 🧪
3. **Password_generator** - Try to creat your passwor true my code... 😉 ; CMD // go run password_generator.go
4. **Packages & Modules** - I will prepare something like that.. 🗃️
5. **(Upcoming) Small Projects** - Mini-projects as I get better - from CLI apps to web servers! 🚀 <br><br>
**in_process...**
6. **API_IP** which give you info about your IP address - API code is from this website [https://api.ipify.org](https://apiip.net/user/dashboard)

## 🌟 Why Go?

Honestly, why not? I’ve heard things like **goroutines** 🐧 and **concurrency** 🤹‍♂️, and it sounds like a language worth exploring. Plus, Go is clean, fast, and is all the rage for backend and system programming!

So if you’re here to learn, laugh, or just want to see some Go code in action, you’re in the right place!

## 👀 Current Status

Right now, this repo is in its *learning phase* 🐣. That means it may have more questions than answers, but that’s part of the journey. Feel free to dive in, leave comments, or even point me in the right direction if you’re feeling generous!

---

## 🚀 Future Goals

1. **Build a small CLI app** - Something useful…ish.
2. **Explore Concurrency with Goroutines** - Because *why not make things difficult?*
3. **Connect Go with a Database** - For that full-stack feel!
